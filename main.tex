\section{Introduction}

This document provides detailed documentation of a Point of Sale (POS) system designed specifically for small to medium-sized catering and beauty businesses. The platform centralizes customer order management, supports scheduling and handling of appointments and provides a universal software-based service suitable for a wide range of day-to-day business operational needs.

\section{Business flows}
\subsection{Practical business flow examples}
To start of with building a POS system, practical examples as to the possible business flows are required.

A practical example involving a walk-in customer order:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Clients arrive to a restaurant;

    % rezervacijos nebūtinos restoranams
    \item Waiter asks if they have a reservation;
    
    \item Clients do not have a reservation, waiter checks if there are free tables in the system, if so, occupies a table in the system and guides them to the free table;
    
    \item Waiter takes clients' order;
    
    \item Waiter registers clients' order in the system, complete with food, drink or other items, includes special requests or allergies;
    
    \item Kitchen staff receives the order and starts preparing it;
    
    \item Kitchen staff selects that the meals are ready in the system, they are delivered to the table by the waiter;
    
    \item Clients ask for additional items;
    
    \item Waiter takes clients' additional order and registers it to the same order;
    
    \item Clients ask for the bill;
    
    \item Waiter extracts the itemized and tax-included receipt from the system for their table, may provide split bills;
    
    \item Clients pay using cash, bank or gift card;
    
    \item Clients possibly leave a tip;
    
    \item Waiter registers the tip in the system and finalizes the order in the system marking it as complete;
\end{enumerate}

An example of a beauty salon appointment:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A customer visits a beauty salon or calls on the phone to make a reservation for an appointment;
    
    \item The receptionist asks what type of service the client wants;
    
    \item The client specifies which service they need and the receptionist checks the system for free time slots for that service;
    
    \item The client chooses when they would like to have the appointment.
    
    \item The receptionist creates a reservation for the specified time and types in the following information of the appointment: client's name and telephone number, the time of the appointment, the service type and the specialist doing the service;
    
    \item The system registers the appointment and adds to it the time it was created;
    
    \item The client receives an SMS saying that the reservation has been made;
    
    \item After a few days the client calls the salon and asks to change the appointment time;
    
    \item The receptionist finds the reservation and changes the appointment time to another available time;
    
    \item The client shows up at the salon on the day of their appointment;
    
    \item The receptionist asks if they have a reservation;
    
    \item The client does have a reservation and tells the receptionist their name;
    
    \item The receptionist finds the reservation in the system, creates an order for the appointment and selects the chosen services;
    
    \item After the appointment, the client goes to the receptionist to pay;
    
    \item The system adds a tax to the order. The receptionist may add a discount and the client can choose to give a tip;
    
    \item The client can pay by cash, credit or debit card and a gift card;
    
    \item After the payment is processed, the order is closed;
\end{enumerate}
